## Note to Artists

Hi creative person! Interested in contributing to the textures for this mod? 🎨

I'm looking for someone to overhaul the images for the following items:

- items/redbulb.png
- items/bluebulb.png
- items/greenbulb.png
- items/purplebulb.png
- blocks/shreddedplant.png
- blocks/shreddedplastic.png
- blocks/shreddedstarch.png
- blocks/plasticwaste.png

The main palette used for the blocks/machines in this mod is shown below:

</p>

In terms of artistic direction, the mod's design style is inspired roughly by Lego (50%), Astroneer (25%) and WALL-E (25%). Love those things too? This project might be for you!

If I end up using your textures, you will of course receive full credit both on CurseForge and in the mod itself for your work. Sadly as this is a passion project I will not be able to reimburse you monetarily for your time - apologies 😓

If you'd like to have a go at improving these textures let me know on Discord at MoonMan#7432 or via email at moonmanmodding@gmail.com with a few examples of your artwork.

## Thanks ❤
